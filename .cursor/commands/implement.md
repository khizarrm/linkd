I want to implement the feature. Context: RESEARCH.MD and PLAN.MD have been provided above. Instructions:
1. Execute Step 1 ONLY.
2. Verify it works as described.
3. Mark Step 1 as completed (change [ ] to [x]).
4. STOP and ask for confirmation before proceeding to Step 2.
Do not deviate from the plan. If the plan is wrong, stop and tell me.
**EXCEPTION: If the user says 'do all' you may do all steps at once**.
